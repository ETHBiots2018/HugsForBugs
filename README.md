# HugsForBugs - DAO Democracy 2.0

## Our Project Idea
What is the social/econimic/environmental challenge we want to solve?
- Legacy voting system relies on trusted authority
- Possibility to entrust one's vote to others with tokens (Liquid Democracy)
- Simplify petition process

What is our approach to the solution?
- Create **verifiable, secret, integrated, resistent** voting system on (ethereum) blockchain (decentralized trust)
  - (de-binarize/quantify voting system)
- Tokenization of voting rights per voting
  - Forward permission to use one's voting token
- Automated creation of voting for successful petitions
- Incentivize people to vote with value backed Tokens (earn money through voting)

## Disruption Potential
What is the outcome for the society?
- More efficient democracy
- Raise trust in political system
- Possibility for trusted democracy on all societal levels -> disruption

What changes as compared to the status quo?
- Possibility to:
  - revote
  - forward vote
  - hand in votes securely from anywhere
    - decentralization

## Difficulties We Experienced
Where could we identify potential negative outcomes?
- Rise of vote market
- Need for internet access
- Secure storing of private key

Which questions remain to be solved?
- Incentivize voted (person) to hold promises
  - elected token
